This is a Pebble watch face, originally created (to the best of my understanding) by MichaelEhrmann, and then updated by KarbonPebbler and Bob TheMadCow.  (My appologies if I have left out any other contributors.  If I have, please let me know.)  This version is a tweak of the updates posted by Bob TheMadCow.  The following is a list of the changes from Bob TheMadCow's version:

1)  Moon phase is fixed so that it shows correctly.
2)  The watch hand has been slimmed down so that it obscures less.
3)  The day/date information has been changed to a single line such as "Mon Oct 8, 2013" rather than four separate pieces.
4)  The watch face has been shifted down to allow the single day/date line.
5)  The digital time on the watch face has been made much larger to be easier to read.
6)  The numbers 6,12,18,24 have been removed from the watch face to make it less cluttered.
7)  The hourly tick marks on the face have been made slightly larger.
8)  Some tweaks to the sunrise/sunset text display.

There is both a compiled version included, as well as the src and resources stuff needed to compile it yourself.
