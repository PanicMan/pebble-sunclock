{"name":"Twilight Sunclock","tagline":"A daily almanac for your Pebble.","body":"Displays lunar phase, sunrise and sunset times, and grey bands representing civil, nautical and astronomical twilight on a 24-hour watch dial. An hour hand indicates the current time, somewhat in the fashion of a sundial gnomon, but it's good over all 24 hours. Also includes a digital time/date display, which honors your Pebble's 12/24 hour configuration.\r\n\r\n### Instructions\r\nFor this version, no manual configuration is needed or supported: the watchface uses Pebble javascript to retrieve the user's current location and timezone each time it is started. These values are saved in the watch for those occasions when the phone / network connection is unavailable.\r\n\r\nIf you travel to another location or daylight savings time starts or stops, simply ensure that your phone is connected to your Pebble and to a location source (could be the phone network). Then if the Twilight Sunclock watchface is presently running on your Pebble press the watch's menu button (the middle button on the right side) to exit the watchface. Then re-start the Twilight Sunclock watchface on your Pebble. It should reacquire your current location and timezone values (as known by your phone) within a few seconds.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis is a Pebble v2.x port of a Pebble 1.x version. The 1.x line had a succession of contributors. It was originally created (to the best of my understanding) by Michael Ehrmann (@mehrmann) and then updated by @KarbonPebbler, Chad Harp (@harpchad), @BobTheMadCow and David Orgeman (@orgemd). (My apologies if I have left out any other contributors. If I have, please let me know.)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
